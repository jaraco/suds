Overview
=================================================

"Suds" is a lightweight SOAP-based web service client for Python licensed under
LGPL (see the ``LICENSE.txt`` file included in the distribution).

"suds-bis" is a fork of the ``suds-jurko`` project which was itself
a fork of the original ``suds`` Python library
project, both which stalled.

For development notes see the ``HACKING.rst`` document included in the
distribution.
